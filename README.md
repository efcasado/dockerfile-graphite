Graphite Dockerfile
===================


### Build

```
make
```


### Usage

```
make start
```

```
make stop
```

> Note that if you are running Docker on OS X you will have to set up
> port forwarding from your OS X to the Docker host virtual machine.
> This can easily be done by running the following command:
>
> ```
> VBoxManage controlvm "<docker-host-name>" natpf1 "<pfrule-name>,tcp,,<local-port>,,<remote-port>"
> ```
>
> Note that the above command will only work if the Docker host
> virtual machine is running. If the machine is stopped, you can use
> this other command instead:
>
> ```
> VBoxManage modifyvm "<docker-host-name>" --natpf1 "<pfrule-name>,tcp,,<local-port>,,<remote-port>"
> ```
